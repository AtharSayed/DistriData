# Word Frequency Count with PySpark

This project demonstrates how to count the frequency of words from a text file using PySpark. The steps involve reading a text file, processing the text to split it into words, and counting the occurrences of each word using PySpark's RDD (Resilient Distributed Datasets) transformations.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PySpark installed on your system. You can install PySpark using:

  ```bash
  pip install pyspark
