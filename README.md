# PySpark and Spark Projects: Distributed Data Processing

Welcome to this repository, which contains various projects and examples related to **PySpark**, **Apache Spark**, and **Distributed Data Processing**. These projects demonstrate how to use Spark's powerful capabilities for processing large datasets in a distributed manner, using Python as the programming language with PySpark.

## Introduction

Apache Spark is an open-source unified analytics engine for big data processing. It provides high-level APIs in multiple languages (Python, Java, Scala, and R), and supports a variety of workloads such as batch processing, streaming, machine learning, and graph processing.

PySpark is the Python API for Apache Spark. With PySpark, you can write Spark applications in Python and perform distributed data processing tasks across large datasets.

This repository includes several projects that showcase the power of Spark and PySpark for processing large-scale data in a distributed environment. Some of the tasks covered include:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Distributed data transformations
- Aggregations and joins
- Machine learning workflows using Spark MLlib
- Real-time stream processing with Spark Streaming

## Labs & Works 

Here is a list of the key work done  included in this repository:

1. **Data Cleaning and Transformation**  
   - Description: This project shows how to load large datasets, clean and preprocess the data, and perform common transformations like filtering, mapping, and reducing.
   
2. **Distributed Aggregation**  
   - Description: Demonstrates how to perform aggregations on distributed data, including group by operations and various statistical calculations.

3. **Real-Time Streaming with PySpark**  
   - Description: Shows how to implement real-time stream processing with PySpark and Spark Streaming. This includes reading from sources like Kafka or socket streams.

4. **Spark SQL Queries**  
   - Description: Demonstrates the use of Spark SQL for querying structured data with SQL-like syntax, enabling data analysis on distributed datasets.

## Prerequisites

Before running the projects in this repository, make sure you have the following software installed:

- **Java 8 or later** (Spark is written in Scala and requires Java to run)
- **Apache Spark** (You can install it from [the official Spark website](https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html))
- **Python 3.x** (PySpark works with Python 3)
- **PySpark** (Install via pip with `pip install pyspark`)
