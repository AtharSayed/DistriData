# Spark DataFrame and ML Practice

## Overview

This repository contains various Spark-based data analysis and machine learning practices, using **Apache Spark** and **PySpark**. The primary focus is on utilizing **DataFrames**, **RDDs**, and **Spark MLlib** for performing data preprocessing, transformation, and machine learning tasks on different datasets.

Throughout the repository, multiple operations like filtering, aggregating, and transforming data using DataFrames are demonstrated. Additionally, it showcases how to build a basic **Linear Regression** model with Spark to predict a target variable based on certain features.

## Key Concepts Covered

### 1. **Working with DataFrames**
   - Loading data from CSV and other file formats.
   - Exploring data (viewing first few rows, schema inspection).
   - Data filtering and transformation.
   - Handling missing or null values.
   - Aggregating data using built-in functions like `mean`, `count`, `agg`, etc.
   - Basic statistical analysis like calculating averages and standard deviations.

### 2. **Using RDDs**
   - Converting DataFrames into RDDs.
   - Applying transformations and actions on RDDs.
   - Performing operations like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.

### 3. **Modeling with Spark MLlib**
   - Data preprocessing with **VectorAssembler** to combine features.
   - Building machine learning models (e.g., **Linear Regression**) to predict a target variable.
   - Evaluating the performance of models using predictions and comparing them with actual values.
